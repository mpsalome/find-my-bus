# find-my-bus

Project done on Vue and deployed with heroku.

I used vue router to set up application routes and vuex to manage different application states.

This project connects to the public transport API of the Government of the city of SÃ£o Paulo to:
1 - View the time in which a bus line will pass through each of your bus stops.
2 - View all buses that will pass by that bus stop.
